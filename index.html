        <h2 id="surviving">Surviving in Null-Sec</h2>
        <p>In null-sec space, survival is crucial. Here are some essential tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use Dscan: Dscan is a vital tool for detecting potential threats in your vicinity. Regularly check Dscan to identify and monitor other ships in your area.</li>
          <li>Watch Local: The Local chat channel displays a list of players in your current system. Keep an eye on Local to see if any new or hostile players enter the system.</li>
          <li>Report Intel: In null-sec alliances, it is common to have an Intel channel where players report any potential threats or suspicious activities. Participate in reporting and sharing relevant information to help protect your fellow alliance members.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="money-making">Money Making Methods</h2>
        <p>There are several money-making methods in null-sec space:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gas Huffing: Gas huffing involves harvesting gases from cosmic anomalies. These gases can be used for various purposes, including manufacturing boosters and synthesizing drugs.</li>
          <li>Mining: Mining in null-sec space involves extracting valuable resources from asteroids. These resources, such as minerals and ore, can be used for various purposes, including manufacturing and building structures.</li>
          <li>Salvaging: Salvaging involves recovering valuable materials from wrecked ships and structures. By salvaging wrecks left behind by other players, you can obtain valuable components and materials.</li>
          <li>Ratting: Ratting is a common money-making method in null-sec space. It involves hunting and destroying NPC pirates, commonly referred to as "rats." Rats often drop valuable loot, including modules, salvage materials, and blueprints that can be sold for ISK (in-game currency).</li>
