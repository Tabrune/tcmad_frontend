        <h2 id="welcome">Welcome to the Wiki</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the TCMAD Wiki (We The Foundation). This wiki aims to provide valuable information and resources related to EVE Online and null-sec space. Whether you are a seasoned capsuleer or a new recruit, this wiki will serve as a valuable reference to enhance your knowledge and understanding of various aspects of the game.</p>

        <h2 id="ratting">Ratting</h2>
        <p>Ratting is a common money-making method in null-sec space. It involves hunting and destroying NPC pirates, commonly referred to as "rats." Rats often drop valuable loot, including modules, salvage materials, and blueprints that can be sold for ISK (in-game currency).</p>

        <h2 id="mining">Mining</h2>
        <p>Mining in null-sec space involves extracting valuable resources from asteroids. These resources, such as minerals and ore, can be used for various purposes, including manufacturing and building structures. Mining operations can be lucrative, especially in regions with rich asteroid belts and valuable ore types.</p>

        <h2 id="incursions">Incursions</h2>
        <p>Incursions are large-scale PvE (Player versus Environment) events that occur in high-security and occasionally in low-security space. However, incursions can also occur in null-sec space. They involve fighting against powerful NPC fleets and completing objectives as part of a group. Incursions offer substantial ISK rewards and valuable loyalty point rewards that can be exchanged for valuable items.</p>
